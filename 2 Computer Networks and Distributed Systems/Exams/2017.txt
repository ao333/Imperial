p = (T1 - T0 - h)/2
(234 - 220 - 2)/2 = 6
(262 - 250 - 2)/2 = 5
(307 - 274 - 2)/2) = 15.5
15.5 is outlier, thus (6+5)/2=5.5ms

IP addresses are divided into A,B,C,D,E classes. Classe A starts its 32 bit IP Address with 0. Each subsequent addresses prefixes an
additional 1 in front. 216 = 2^7-2^6-2^4-^2^3 = 110 11000. 110 is class C

b
Class A has 24 bits for host, B has 16 bits, C has 8 bits. All 0 is Network ID and 1 is Broadcast ID, not allowed. Thus 2^8-2=254 Addresses

c
192 = 2^7-2^6 = First 2 of 8 bit host addresses are 1. 2^2=4 subnets and 2^(8-2)-2=62 hosts per subnet.

d
216.0.0.128 = 2^7 = 10 (Cannot change network bits, or use all 0s or 1s). Thus 1000 0001 to 1011 1110 -> 126.0.0.129 to 126.0.0.190.
Broadcast would be all 1 for non-network part: 1011 1111 -> 126.0.0.191

e
10.0.0.0/8 -> 10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0/12 -> 172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0/16 -> 192.168.255.255

NAT translates Internal/Private address, to External/IP Addresses. Routes internal network using Gateway box with external and internal
address. Box maintains this mapping for incoming traffic (replies). Port mappings maintained on gateways to make services on private hosts
available to public hosts.

Solutions for limited IP Addresses
  Applicant needs to show that addresses will be utilised
  Allocate networks with subnet masks
  Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)
  Reuse addresses in different parts of network (Network Address Translation)
  Add more address bits IPv6

f
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
Host broadcasts request for IP address (DHCP DISCOVER packet)
DHCP server allocates free IP address and sends it to host
  IP addresses are chosen from pool
  DHCP OFFER packet
Uses Ethernet address of the DHCP DISCOVER packet
  IP addresses are only leased for a fixed period of time
  Host must renew the lease before it expires or IP is returned to the pool
Other information DHCP is used for
  IP address of the default gateway including network mask
  IP addresses of name servers and time servers
  Can be extended by custom fields

b
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM): 231 231... Used in telephone networks, TV schedule
  Subdivide channel into fixed time slots
  Encode many signals by transmitting them at different times (round-robin fashion)
Consider:
  Whole bandwidth of the channel usable for duration of slot but input signals must have less than medium bandwidth / number of channels
  Introduces delay while waiting for slot (Gap between slots must not interfere with requirements)
  Someone must allocate time slots
  Needs synchronisation to keep track of slots
  Fixed allocation bad for bursty data

Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM): Used in radio, TV, GSM2
  Encode different signals by sending at different frequencies
Consider:
  Need guard bands because filters imprecise
  Someone must allocate frequencies to users

Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA): Satellite Transmission
  Imagine many groups having conversations in same room
    TDM: taking turns to talk
    FDM: talking in isolated groups not heard by others
    CDMA: everyone talking in different languages
  Stations transmit over entire frequency spectrum
  Stations combine data bits with own code sequence
  Interference between signals occurs
  Separation made using coding theory
Consider:
  Interference needs to be controlled
  Requires sophisticated signal power management (everyone can talk as long as no one talks too loudly)
  Soft degradation as number of stations increases
  Only practical for communication with central station

c
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
  Hosts maintain lookup tables (e.g. hash tables) of IP/data link address mappings for LAN
  If host A has no entry for host B
    A broadcasts ARP Request requesting data link address for B’s IP address
    B recognises its IP address and returns ARP response with its data link address
  Usual method on IP networks that use Ethernet
  Hosts cache these tables
    B also adds A’s mapping to its own table (Likely to need it in future exchanges)

Application Layer
  Provides interface to application but but does not include the application
  Most users only have contact with application layer
  Protocols for common application interactions are for example: file transfer, e-mail, web, IM, video telephony
