i) SYN (Transport Layer): Control bit containing synchronise sequence numbers 
Indicates position in byte stream
Controls packet order, detects loss, and duplicates

ii) Signal Attentuation (Physical Layer): Signal strength decreases over distance. Requires Repeaters to boost it over long distances.

iii) Differential Manchester Encoding (Physical Layer): Binary value represented by presence/absence of transitions
(0: preceding transition; 1: no precedingtransition) Every bit has at least one transition
Polarity does not matter but requires more complex equipment

iv) 2016:2ai

v) IEEE 802.3 Frame Format (Data Link Layer)
Preamble (7 bytes): alternating 0s and 1s to establish synchronisation
  Framing then by timing, spaces between frames plus counting from length field
SFD (Start of frame delimiter, 1 byte): 10101011 indicates start of frame
  Allows receiver to miss part of preamble without missing the start of the next field
Destination address (16 or 48 bits depending on implementation)
  Host(s) intended to receive
    Single host (unicast)
    Group address (multicast)
    Global address (broadcast)
Source address (16 or 48 bit address of sender)
Length (2 bytes, IEEE 802.3 only): Bytes in this frame (optional)
Data (0-1500 bytes): Includes higher layer headers
Pad (0-46 bytes): Ensure frame is long enough to enable collision detection
FCS (4 bytes, Frame Check Sequence): Enables error detection CRC, based on all fields except preamble, SFD and FCS

vi) ICMP (Network Layer)
Ping
  Verify connection to hosts
  Quality of connection (round trip time, dropped packages)
  Sends echos and receives echo replies
Traceroute
  Find out about intermediate hosts (hops)
  Routers send ICMP error messages back for every received packet with TTL=0 (type 11)
  Send packets with increasing TTL for each subsequent packet

b
i) Flow control
Manages data buffers and coordinates traffic (between sender and receiver) to prevent overflows
Fast senders have to pause for slow receivers

ii)
Window size used for flow control: Sender should not send more than window size, 0 means ”no more data now

iii)

  <ACK=2048K/WIN0K

  <ACK=2048K/WIN128K
  SEQ=2048K/128Kbytes>

iv) TCP sender maintains 2 windows: Receiver Window (flow control) and congestion window
Uses whichever currently smaller
Congestion window based on network conditions
Windows grows and shrinks based on packet loss
Different algorithms for finding optimal size, e.g. additive, increase, multiplicative decrease (AIMD)
Requires efficient timeouts to detect loss
TCP measures RTT and adjusts timeouts (drop/block packet)

i) Multiplexing: Sharing channels, Signal occupies bandwidth in channel but it need not occupy whole channel

ii) 2017:4b

iii) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-network-multiplexing-demultiplexing-transport-layer/
UDP and TCP perform the demultiplexing and multiplexing jobs by including two special fields in the segment headers: the source port number
field and the destination port number field.
  Multiplexing – Gathering data from multiple application processes of sender ,enveloping that data with header and sending them as a whole to
the intended receiver is called as multiplexing.
  Demultiplexing – Delivering received segments at receiver side to the correct app layer processes is called as demultiplexing.

b
i)
IP address identifies network and host on that network Device on n networks has n IP addresses - one for each
MAC Address operates on the Data Link Layer between physical devices, cannot understand IP, needs translation

ii)
IP
Class B: 140.247 form Network Address is within 128-191 (10)
60.123 form Host Address
Network is 16-2=14 bits

iii) ARP 2017:4c

iv)
Netmask: 253 -> 255 (should be consecutive 1s)
Default Router: 225 -> 247 (to conform with Address 1)
DNS Server 1: 192 is a private address, should not be made public for DNS
