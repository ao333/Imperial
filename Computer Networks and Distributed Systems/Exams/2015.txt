DNS is not really needed if one can memorize digit strings, and can update thousands of IP addresses changes, locally or rely on a central
server that may be down when one's homework is due. WWW may not be neccessary since we have other internet applications like mail, and cate.
Nonetheless, the DNS can dynamically resolve IP addresses using DHCP, administer domain names to avoid conflict, and to build hierachical
domains suffixes that have meaning. Its distributed nature improves reliability.
The second UDP query likely benefited from DNS caching. The DNS server likely responded to the second request with a stored response whose TTL
has yet to expire, instead of iteratively querying other DNS servers again for a resolution.

d
Why UDP
 Fast/bursty transfers which costs more bandwidth if a guarenteed connection is established (DHCP)
 Requests that does not require confirmation (like DNS)
 Real-time applications where the past is irrelevant are robust to packet losses or delay/out-of-order delivery like VoIP and streaming videos
 Multi/Broadcast: A host cannot establish connections with everyone
 UDP packets can be reorganized into different protocols imitating certain TCP features like checksum
 Less CPU processes due to less router and data processing overheads
Why TCP
 Big files that have huge overhead if transfered packet-by-packet (Establishing a connection with data stream is more efficient)
 Important transfers that make use of full duplex (sequence/acknowledge number detects loss/duplicates and ensures orderly delivery)
 Fast senders should pause for slow receivers to prevent buffer overflows
 Detects congestion by monitoring packet loss caused by store-forwarding (drops packets if buffer becomes full)
 Establishes flow control by using the smaller of receiver or congestion window. Measures RTT using timeouts.
 Secure SSH connections

e
Wireless communication is prone to noise and collision, thus packet loss. TCP regards packet losses as network congestion and will therefore
reduce the window and rate of transfer. More reliability can be added by utilizing the Logical Link Control to detect(CRC/Odd Bit) or correct
errors(FEC). Packets can be framed with count/flags to detect loss.

Networks need to choose when and how much resources to give mediums based on contention, fairness access latency. They can be allocated
statically with bounded latency to transmit like TDM, FDM and CDMA, but that leads to wasted bandwidth. Dynamically allocating resources
on demand leads to collision and contention using CSMA or lower performance using Token Passing.

b
CSMA/CD (Collision Detection)
  Listen to channel while sending
  If collision, abort signal immediately
  Wait random time and try again
Properties
  Does not waste channel sending broken frames
  Gives unbounded time to access network
  Designed for fair access
Ensure sender still sending when collision noise arrives
  Must send for twice the propagation delay
802.3 allows for 2.5 km max LAN (with repeaters)
  Specifies minimum frame length that takes at least 50µs to propagate (includes 4 repeaters)
  Assuming 100 ns transmission delay for sending 1 bit (10 Mbps link), this means at least 500 bits, rounded up to 512 (safety), hence the pad
(7 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 46 + 4) ? 8 = 512 bits
  Takes 51.2µs on a 10 Mbps link
  Time to detect collision over longest network while still transmitting
Must avoid repeated collisions At nth retry, wait between 0 and 2^n?1 slot times (51.2µs)
  Do this up to a maximum of 1023 slot times
  Give up on 16th collision
Properties
  Low delay if frames of 2 hosts collide
  Reasonable delay if frames of many hosts collide
Hidden terminal problem
  Signals from A and C collide (at B) but A and C cannot hear each other to avoid the collision
Exposed terminal problem
  B and C falsely conclude that they
  cannot send at the same time

CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance)
  sender and receiver initially exchange short frames other stations can overhear
  RTS (Ready to Send) - request the channel
  CTS (Clear To Send) - response to RTS frame
Other stations (A, D) hear exchange (RTS and/or CTS)
Stations infer for how long the channel will be busy (RTS and CTS frames include the size)
ACK (Acknowledgement) - sent on receipt of frame (provides efficient collision recovery)
Repeated failures to transmit result in greater back-off time
Diagram:\3 Data Link Layer:34
  Station with frame to transmit senses medium and waits until it is idle
  When idle, wait for back-off time
  If still idle, transmit data
  If busy, wait until idle and then wait for back-off time
  Back-off time is adjusted exponentially and influenced by IFS (see next slide) and overheard RTS/CTS frames
  Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) as stations act independently
  Collisions are costly as the entire frame is transmitted

c
*Assuming no retransmission, HTTP/1.0 auto closes connections and requires a new 3-TCP-packet handshake for every request:
3(Initial Handshake) + 2(2 Images)*3(Handshake)*2(SEQ/Data+ACK/WIN) + 1(text)*3*2 = 21
HTTP/1.1 allows for a single presistent connection for multiple requests, plus 3 more for client-initiated connection release:
3(Initial Handshake) + 2*2 + 1*2 + 3(connection release)= 12

i) HTTP is an application layer protocol used by WWW to define message (image/text/etc) format and transmission. It also defines interactions
between servers and browsers. It establishes a TCP connection with a server and use GET/POST/PUT or other methods to request/send information.
It identifies users and maintains state through cookies. 

ii) Switches and Bridges operate on Data Link Layer. It listens to traffic and builds address/port table mappings based on source and
destination MAC addresses in the header using loop-free spanning tree. It purges entries that have their TTL expired. If source port, don't
forward. If port for destination MAC known, forward only to that port, else flood all but source port to find destination.
They used to join LANs together, thus forming the ends of collision domains and administration. When speeds between different networks
differ, it can store and forward (check CRC) or Cut-through (No Check). All this adds transmission and processing delays.

iii) Subnets exist on the network layer to help reduce network complexity by breaking it into local networks to assist in traffic routing and
harmonize differences between different protocols, technologies, and administrative ownerships.

iv) Address Resolution Protocol is a network layer protocol used for translating IP into data link layer addresses, since data link layer
Network Interface Cards do not understand (are transparent to) network layer IP addresses. NIC manufacturers request 48-bit Ethernet
Addresses from the IEEE to avoid conflict when similar cards appear on the same LAN. It works by allowing hosts to main lookup tables of
IP/data link address mappings for LAN. If host A has no entry for host B, A broadcasts ARP requests requesting the data link address for B's
IP address. B recognizes its IP address and returns an ARP response with its data link address.

Confidentiality: Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorised users + prevent analysis of traffic characteristics.
Integrity: Prevent modification of information by unauthorised users – includes no duplication, replays, insertions or reordering.
Availability: Prevent denial of service e.g. by disruption

Identification: Establishing the identity of the subject using Name, ID provided by user, Workstation address, Magnetic/Smart card
Prevention: Use name/initials not numbers, Same ID for ALL systems & email, Individual accountability, unique ID for each user Identify users
in logs and audit trails, No sharing of ID

Authentication: Validity of the identity of sender or server. Personal Identification Number (PIN) for cards, Passwords, Biometrics eg. retina
or fingerprint scanning, Maximum authentication attempts (e.g.3), Logging and investigation of all authentication failures.
Prevention: Based on challenge-response protocols where the authenticated party needs to prove knowledge/possession of a secret. Host
generates random number r which is sent to Smart Card. Card uses one way function F, seeded with cryptographic key K and PIN number to
calculate response which is sent back to host. Host uses same function to check response. Not susceptible to replay
Access Control: Control over who has access to services or resources within the system. Network, Operating System

Passive Attack: Observe information in network without interference. Breaks confidentiality by analyzing message content, traffic frequency/
length/source/destination

Active Attack: Modify message contents or message stream – Delete, delay, reorder, replay, insert valid or invalid messages, Masquerade as
authorised user, Denial of service by flooding servers with valid requests, Passwords gained through passive attack can be used for attack

i) Packet Filtering Routers (a.k.a. Chokes, Screening Filters) drops packets based on the destination/source addresses/ports, type field of IP
packets. For performance reasons, IP filtering is usually performed by a process within the operating system kernel of a router. If multiple
firewalls are used, the first marks certain packets for more exhaustive examination by a later firewall, allowing ‘clean’ packets to proceed.
It is possible to filter based on sequences of IP packets, for example, to prevent access to an FTP server before a login has been performed.

ii) Circuit-level Gateways that provide higher-level processing e.g. authenticating users, cleaning/redirecting data, logging, and
auditing/accounting. Gateway apps normally run on BASTION HOSTS. Can drop connections based on destination, incorrect connection
packets, time, volume. Normally used for Inside-to-Outside connections. Client normally recompiled to connect to CL-Gateway port.

iii) Application-level Gateways acts as a proxy for an application process. Like CL-GW’s but application-specific (app-knowledgeable). It can
block/filter/report based on app-level msg content, scan for data leaks, viruses, etc, rewrite data, be configured to limit application
features but with more processing overhead than CL-GW’s. For example, a policy may be desired that allows certain internal users to make
Telnet connections to certain external hosts. When a user runs a Telnet program on their local computer, it attempts to establish a TCP
connection with a remote host. The request is intercepted by the TCP gateway. The TCP gateway starts a Telnet proxy process and the original
TCP connection is routed to it. If the proxy approves the Telnet operation (i.e., if the user is authorized to use the requested host) it
establishes another connection to the requested host and relays all of the TCP packets in both directions. A similar proxy process would run
on behalf of each Telnet client, and similar proxies might be employed for FTP and other services.

Security manager is needed only when RMI downloads code from the remote machine. If both client and server use the same classes, it's not
needed. If an RMI program does not install a security manager, RMI will not download classes (other than from the local class path). This
restriction ensures that the operations performed by downloaded code are subject to a security policy. It is needed in server and in client if
stub is loaded from server. Checks various operations performed by a stub to see whether they are allowed access files, link to dynamic
libraries, control virtual machine, manipulate threads, or perform priviledged operations.

b
Remote Procedure Call makes remote calls look like local ones. Client is suspended until the call completes. Parameters must be passed by
value since Client and Server processes do not share memory and thus Client pointers have no meaning in Server address space, encode the
parameters and method name in messages, and to decode them when receiving. Client has a local stub for every remote procedure it can call.
Server has a local skeleton for every procedure which can be called by a remote client. Stub procedures perform: Parameter marshalling
(packing/assemble parameters in communication system messages), Unpacking received messages and assigning values to parameters, Transform data
representations if necessary, Access communication primitives to send/receive messages. Binding/IDL. While RPC encapsulates via OS processes,
RMI seeks to do it through objects. RMI = RPC + Object-orientation
RMI's Advantages over RPC:

i) RPC calls remote functions exported into a server. RMI uses references to remote objects to invoke their methods, and also pass and return
more remote object references that can be distributed among many JVM instances, so it's much more powerful.

ii) RMI support inheritance, allowing interfaces to extend, evolve, specialise behaviour. Can replace existing object and still be compatible
with clients. RPC must have identical interfaces (no inheritance).

iii) Parameterised exceptions -> Simpler error handling.

iv) type checking -> fewer errors

v) Access transparency: Remote and local services accessed by same method/syntax

vi) Location transparency: A user could access files from servers or locally in the same way. (Write once, write everywhere)

c
i) bool call (request, reply) {
   send(request);
   return receive(reply,Time) // returns false if timed out
}
Maybe Call Semantics: If the call fails, the client cannot tell for sure whether the procedure was executed, whether request/reply were
lost or the server crashed. If the call succeeds, the procedure will have been executed exactly once if using a communication service which
does not generate duplicate messages. It's lightweight but leaves issues of state consistency of the server. With respect to the client, up to
the application programmer.

ii) bool call (request, reply) {
    int retries = n;
    while(retries--) {
      send(request);
      if (receive(reply,Time)) return true; }
    return false; // return false if timed out;
}
At-Least-Once retries up to n times. if the call succeeds then procedure has been executed at least once but server may receive up to n
duplicated messages. Useful for idempotent server operations i.e they may be executed many times and have the same effect on server state as a
single execution.

iii) At-Most-Once guarantees that the remote procedure is either never executed or executed partially (due to a server crash) or once. To do
this, the server must keep track of request identifiers and discard retransmitted requests that have not completed execution. On the other
hand, the server must buffer replies and retransmit until acknowledged by the client. Most RPC systems guarantee at-most-once semantics in
the absence of server crashes.

iv) Transactional (Zero or Once) guarantees that either the procedure is completely executed or it is not executed at all. To ensure this, the
server must implement an atomic transaction for each RPC i.e., either the state data in the server is updated permanently by an operation
taking it from one consistent state to another or it is left in its original state, if the call is aborted or a failure occurs. This requires
two phase commit type of protocol.

include projectrank.idl
main(){
  status = export(projectrank,"rankserver",docnameserver);
  status = RPCServerListen();
  ranked = A dictionary where the keys are [studentid]. Values default to [false] to indicate that no votes have been cast
  rankings = A 2D array where the indexes are [studentid][projectid] and the values are myrank
}
rank(studentid,projectid,myrank){
  if !ranked[studentid]{
    ranked[studentid]=true;
    myrank[studentid][projectid] = myrank;
  } else do nothing or send warning as students can only rank once and cannot change their rankings
}
listrank(studentid,projectid,myrank){
  myrank = rankings[projectid][studentid];
}
Both of these operations are idempotent in that one or more execution have the same effect, so they can be repeated.
Consequently they can be used with at-least-once semantics.
